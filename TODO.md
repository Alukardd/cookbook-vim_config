Planning ahead for Christmas 2013
---------------------------------

Useful:

  * Check which plugins should be installed, delete all other folders in bundle (toggleable)
  * Differentiate between create and sync (git)
  * Differentiate between create and sync (mercurial)

Nice to have:

  * Automatically add plugin manager boilerplate to config file (toggleable)
  * Get some user feedback
  * Add delete action to LWRPs

Probably stupid:

  * Test / adjust for Windows
  * Support for private repositories (git)
  * Support for private repositories (mercurial)
  * Read config file snippets from gists
  * turn various config file management modes into LWRPs

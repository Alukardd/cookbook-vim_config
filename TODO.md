Planning ahead for Christmas 2013
---------------------------------

Useful:

  * Re-write README, list all attributes in tables
  * Change string attribute keys to symbols for consistency across my cookbooks
  * Check which plugins should be installed, delete all other folders in bundle (toggleable)
  * Differentiate between create and sync (git)
  * Differentiate between create and sync (mercurial)

Nice to have:

  * Test / adjust for RPM based distributions
  * Automatically add plugin manager boilerplate to config file (toggleable)
  * Get some user feedback
  * Figure out why foodcritic keeps complaining about default actions
  * Find a better way for vim site downloads - maybe use ark
  * Add delete action to LWRPs

Probably stupid:

  * Test / adjust for Windows
  * Support for private repositories (git)
  * Support for private repositories (mercurial)
  * Read config file snippets from gists
  * turn various config file management modes into LWRPs
